# The MotorCyce Detection on Android
The Huge Poject for Mobile Applicaiton "Motor Detection On Android"

## Motivation
hello Guy's we are students from Telkom Universit and the project from major topic Mobile Application that create "Motor Detection on Android Using Tensorflow Library for android studio. hmm this topic is very interested for us.

### What Do you think about Machine Learning and Neural Network?

### What Do you think about Tensorflow?
TensorFlow™ is an open source software library for high performance numerical computation. Its flexible architecture allows easy deployment of computation across a variety of platforms (CPUs, GPUs, TPUs), and from desktops to clusters of servers to mobile and edge devices. Originally developed by researchers and engineers from the Google Brain team within Google’s AI organization, it comes with strong support for machine learning and deep learning and the flexible numerical computation core is used across many other scientific domains.

### What Do you think about Tensorflow Object Detection API?
Creating accurate machine learning models capable of localizing and identifying multiple objects in a single image remains a core challenge in computer vision. The TensorFlow Object Detection API is an open source framework built on top of TensorFlow that makes it easy to construct, train and deploy object detection models. At Google we’ve certainly found this codebase to be useful for our computer vision needs, and we hope that you will as well.
